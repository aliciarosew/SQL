#In this project, I am querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many roders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'; 

#2. How many January orders wer for iPhones?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID';

#3. Provide customer account numbers for all orders placed in February:

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id)=6
AND order_id<>'Order ID';

#4. What was the cheapest product sold in January and what was the price?

SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What was the revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, ROUND(SUM(quantity)*price,2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. What was the quantity and total revenue for each product sold to 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101 in February?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS quantity, ROUND(SUM(quantity)*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 items at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderid
WHERE feb.Quantity>2
AND length(order_id)=6
AND order_id<>'Order ID';
